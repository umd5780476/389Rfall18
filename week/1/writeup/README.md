### Part 2 (75 pts)

As a junior developer tasked with performing a security audit, your role is to identify security issues and provide this information to other members of the company. Making business decisions, mitigating risks, and hiring developers is not your responsibility. 

Clearly, you should let your boss know of any security problems you encounter. Hiding bugs that could later be exploited is unethical from an employee/employer relationship and from a consumer’s viewpoint. Going to a consumer watchdog or the public is inappropriate in almost all situations unless you have proof of an incredibly severe issue and you have already tried everything to resolve the issue internally. 

If you do nothing and sit on a security issue instead of notifying your boss, you are responsible for any harm that occurs. It’s your role in the company to find issues and notify the correct people.

In the case where you sufficiently notify your boss and he or she fails to address the problem, it is your duty to further press the issue and ensure it is resolved. Failing to act further because you informed someone else is negligence. You should not resign yourself from the responsibility of preventing harm, but at the same time, you should be aware of your role in the company and not overstep when it is unnecessary.
